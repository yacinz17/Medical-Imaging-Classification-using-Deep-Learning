# Medical Imaging Classification using Deep Learning

This project applies deep learning techniques to classify medical images and assist in disease diagnosis.  
It uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for automated feature extraction and classification.

## Features
- Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation).
- CNN model built with **TensorFlow/Keras**.
- Option for transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., MobileNetV2, EfficientNet).
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Loss curves.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
